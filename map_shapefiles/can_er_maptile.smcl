{hi:can_er} generates a map of Canadian economic regions.

{pstd}An economic region is a grouping of complete census divisions (with one exception in Ontario) created as a standard geographic unit for analysis of regional economic activity. {browse "http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/92-195-x/2011001/geo/er-re/er-re-eng.htm":[Source]}

{pstd}This template uses the boundaries from the 2011 Census.

{synopt :{opt mapifprov}}excludes the territories from the map, only mapping the 10 provinces{p_end}

{p 32 32 2}This does not exclude the territories' data from the calculation of the quantiles (equal-sized color bins). To avoid counting the territories in the quantiles, add an {bf:if} statement to your maptile command that excludes them.{p_end}

{p 32 32 2}{opt mapifprov} is equivalent to {opt mapif( <province, not territory> )} but additionally adjusts the legend placement.{p_end}

{synopt :{opt legendoffset(#)}}manually shifts the legend downward. # must be non-negative. When not specified, the legend offset is computed automatically.{p_end}
