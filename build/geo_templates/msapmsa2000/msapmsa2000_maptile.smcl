{pstd}This maptile geography was prepared under the supervision of Jonathan Dingel (Chicago Booth). The underlying CMSA and state shapefiles were obtained from http://www.nhgis.org, with full citation: Minnesota Population Center. National Historical Geographic Information System: Version 2.0. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota 2011.
These are based on the 2000 TIGER/Line files located at: http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html. To improve the speed of map creation, maps are simplified via mapshaper.org using Visvalingam/weighted area to .20%, then repairing line intersections.
