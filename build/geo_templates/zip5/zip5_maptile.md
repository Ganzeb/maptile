**maptile {hline 2} Geography: zip5**

# Description

**zip5** generates a map of United States 5-digit ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs), using the Census 2000 definition.

It displays Alaska and Hawaii rescaled and moved to the bottom left of the map, below the continental US, for ease of viewing.

For information on how ZCTAs are different from ZIP codes, see the U.S. Census Bureau's [information page](http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html) and [FAQ](http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctafaq.html).
